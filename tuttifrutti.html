            <h2><strong>What is Tutti-frutti?</strong></h2>
            <p>Tutti-frutti is candied fruit, typically watermelon, papaya, raisins, currants, etc. You can make it by boiling fruit of your choice in a simple sugar syrup. Tutti-frutti first originated in Italy as a flavor for ice cream with candied fruits, nuts, and occasionally dried fruits. Tutti-frutti traces back to a receipt from 1860 with recipes for/using it in the late 19th century. Tutti-frutti also refers to a flavor with it being one of the first gum flavors sold in a New York vending machine. While this term clearly has multiple interpretations, the tutti-frutti I use for this cake is candied papaya that gets artificially colored.</p>
