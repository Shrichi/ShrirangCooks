                            Welcome! My name is Shrirang Ra
                            thi, I am 16 years old and I am a junior who g
                            es to North Creek High School. Some of my hobbies include cooking, mainly baking but some other stuff as well, playing sports with my friends, and video games. I’m pretty smart, I get good grades in school, and am in a few clubs. My favorite subject would probably be physics or math because I love the explainability of things and understanding how they work. I use this in cooking as well where I love to do research and watch videos on cooking to learn more about it and understand how it works. This helps me easily make my own tweaks to recipes which allows me to be more creative with my food.
                            Although my future may not be certain yet, one thing is, I love cooking! This passion of mine started in the dark age, quarantine. I’m pretty sure everyone had their fair share of crazes at this time including me. In the first few months of quarantine I, like everyone was VERY bored, so I took up Madhubani art. This is an Indian art style that my sister does and I thought I’d give it a try. In those 3-4 months I made around 8 paintings, but by then I was getting bored of it and school was starting so I had less time anyways. I went on focusing on just school, along with a bit of video games. That went on until guess what, that's right I got bored, again. But this time it was going to be different.
                            My dad’s birthday was coming up, but Covid was crazy and we weren't going to the store just to get a cake. What's a birthday without cake?! I wasn't going to let that happen, so I made one. I had made cakes before but those were all simple cakes. I made a plain chocolate cake and took a look at it. I had made previous cakes for fun and they had looked better, and this was for a birthday! So I decided to decorate it. This was something I had never done before and frankly I didnt even see myself as a creative person. But I was up for it. I covered it in some chocolate whipped cream frosting and smoothed the edges. It was still looking a little bland so I took my moms old piping tube and added a few swirls on it, as well as some shaved chocolate and sliced strawberries on top. I was proud of myself and best of all, my dad loved it. That was the moment I realized, I loved cooking.

                        <p>Hi! Welcome to Shrirang Cooks where I show you some of my favorite recipes, each one unique and absolutely delectable. I’m Shrirang, the guy who cooks, and I’m here to share with you guys some of the amazing recipes I have made throughout my life.</p>
                        <p>My journey with food started over quarantine where I had far too much free time on my hands. Over the long quarantine I tried exploring many creative things to pass my time such as drawing, painting, etc., but none of them clicked with me the way making food did. It started with my dad’s birthday where we couldn’t get a cake for him due to social distancing restrictions. I felt really bad about this since what’s a birthday without a cake, so I decided to make him one.</p>
                        <p>Since that one birthday I have made many more foods and not just cakes, but so many other delicious recipes. All of my recipes are vegetarian and eggless and are simple enough for any level of cook to enjoy making and eating. I hope that through this website I can inspire everyone to cherish food as much as I do and I hope you guys are ready to do some cooking!</p>
